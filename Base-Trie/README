This part explains the Trie data structure and provides a simple sample implementation in C++

1. Tries are used to index and search in a text;

2. some examples of tries usage include finding the longest prefix, match in a routing table, auto complete of web addresses in browser etc;

3. Trie is a tree where each vertex represents a word or prefix;

4. The root represents an empty string;

5. Markers are used to indicate end of words;

6. A typical node in a trie includes the content (a char), marker for end of word and a collection of children.
